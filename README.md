# LoUG-AR
An AR Simulator to give a more intuitive understanding of how gravity works between large bodies in space. Compress the laws of physics to let us play with gravity in our living room. 

Built originally for Vive then improved and ported to Magic Leap. Consider a mobile AR app for accessibility.
